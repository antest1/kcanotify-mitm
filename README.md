# kcanotify mitm addon

A [kcanotify](https://github.com/antest1/kcanotify) addon which uses [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org) to decrypt the TLS/SSL connections and show the decrypted data in the app.

The addon uses the open source framework [chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy) to bundle and run python modules. The native python modules are pre-built and installed from the chaquopy [pip repository](https://chaquo.com/pypi-7.0).

The project is a fork of [PCAPdroid-mitm](https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid-mitm) by [Emanuele Faranda](https://github.com/emanuele-f).
